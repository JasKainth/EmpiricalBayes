# EmpiricalBayes

## Summary

We will take a look at what what Empirical Bayes is and what it has to offer.  

## Bayesian_vs_Frequentist  

In this papeer, we will first, very briefly, introduce the concept of Empirical Bayes and why it is useful. Then, we will compare how the Emirical Bayes methods and results differ to Frequentist for estimates, credible intervals vs confidence intervals, hypothesis testing, etc.

To gain a deeper understanding of Empirical Bayes, I read the textbook  Introduction to Empirical Bayes by David Robinson which is a fantastic textbook since it introduces concepts via examples rather than strictly mathematical formulas. If you are interested, it can be purchased *[here](https://gumroad.com/l/empirical-bayes)*.
